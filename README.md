=======
[![Build Status](https://github.com/lividhen/GmsCore/workflows/Build/badge.svg)]
**WIP**

NYAGmsCore is a FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) mod of micro g's [GmsCore](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore) that can be installed on systems with locked bootloaders where GMS cannot be completly removed. Which... feels like it should be illegal.  

Trying to work on a solution for making apps use the modified micro g. If you have any ideas please let me know!
